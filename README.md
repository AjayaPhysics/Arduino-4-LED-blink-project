# Arduino-4-LED-blink-project
YouTube video on the Arduino 4 LED blink project
“Before we begin, here’s what you’ll need for this project:
An Arduino Uno
4 LEDs (any colour)
4 Resistors (220 ohms or 330 ohms)
Jumper Wires
A Breadboard
And of course, your computer with the Arduino IDE installed.”
We’ll connect:
LED 1 to Pin 8
LED 2 to Pin 9
LED 3 to Pin 10
LED 4 to Pin 11
Then, attach resistors to the negative side of each LED and connect them to the GND pin on the Arduino. This setup ensures that our LEDs won’t burn out.”
“Now it’s time to write the code. Open the Arduino IDE and let’s type in a simple code to make all 4 LEDs blink in sequence.”
